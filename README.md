# ClumsyBat
A deceivingly cute and playful 2D side-scrolling avoidance game.  Reminiscent of Flappy Bird, Clumsy Bat includes upgradeable abilities, a variety of obstacles, and RPG and story elements. Designed for touch-screen mobile devices (Android and Apple), the player uses touch gestures to control the character to get to the end of each level unscathed. Boss levels included.

All included C# script files, custom materials, sound effects and music are my own work. All 2D artwork is by Scott Robinson.
